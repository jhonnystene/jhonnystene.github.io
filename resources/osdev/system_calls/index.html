                System calls are surprisingly simple to implement, if you do it correctly. I've been used to the <a href="http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/">MikeOS</a>
                method, which involves having jmp statements to your functions at a predefined point in your operating system. This is actually a pretty bad way
                of doing it in most cases, though. The proper way is to register an interrupt that handles system calls, and to store a structure
                containing the arguments to your system call. There is pseudocode available <a href="/resources/osdev/system_calls/pseudocode.txt">here</a>.
