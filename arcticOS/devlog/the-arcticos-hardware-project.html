				<b>Where was the project at before?</b><br>
                The hardware project was always in a bit of a tough spot. Early prototypes are always the most expensive to develop,
                because you either have to use development boards (which are often at LEAST 5x the price of components) or you have to
                design your own board and hope it works (which I did do at one point, but it barely worked) - the second one is good if
                you're building 20-30 prototypes, but the losses from not buying in bulk + the expensive shipping make it far from cost-effective.<br>
                Because of that, the prototypes have usually been largely cobbled together - EVT3 (the latest prototype) is still a bunch of 
                development boards (plus one of the earlier prototype boards) literally chopped up and wired together to fit.<br><br>

                <b>Why do changes need to be made?</b><br>
                You've probably heard of the current global supply chain issues. They're hitting everyone pretty hard at the moment - many 
                popular chips are marked as having up to 2-year delays before they can be sent (and often, anything above a year means you'll 
                never get the chips) so building hardware is difficult to say the least. Nearly all available chips are already being allotted 
                to large corporations buying thousands (or millions) at a time, so getting those parts without severe markup is incredibly 
                difficult for small companies. Sadly, some of the affected chips are 4G/5G modem chips and audio chips - which are both needed to 
                build a phone. I basically can't hit the $75 price tag anymore, and I refuse to sell a device for more than I'd pay for it.<br><br>

                <b>What is changing about the project?</b><br>
                The phone will be shelved until I can find a way to reliably get the needed chips for a decent price. I have some related hardware in 
                the works, that will be a great companion for those who already have dumbphones. The new hardware will still run arcticOS, and will 
                likely be cheaper (I'm hoping for $50, but I'm not sure yet) then the phone would have been.<br><br>

                <b>When will the new hardware be announced?</b><br>
                Luckily, development doesn't have to restart for me to be able to make the new hardware. The current prototype, EVT3, can be reworked 
                into what I need quite easily. I can't give a "I'll for sure announce it on this day" timeframe, but I do hope to show it off before 
                the end of the year.<br><br>

				<b>How can I help?</b><br>
				One of the best ways to help is to email me suggestions - tell me what you've liked and hated about the devices you've owned, and what you'd
				like to see put into my phone. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:johnny@stene.xyz">johnny@stene.xyz</a><br><br>
				
				You can also help by donating - this goes towards building prototypes and buying the tools nessecary to build the phones. My PayPal is at <a href="https://paypal.me/jhonnystene">paypal.me/jhonnystene</a>
