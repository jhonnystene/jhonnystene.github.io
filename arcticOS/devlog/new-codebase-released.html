			<p>
				The new codebase for arcticOS has been released. The current version comes with support for the ILI9341 display driver, as well as a good template
				for button matrix code. The new codebase is <a href="https://github.com/arcticOS/arcticOS">on Github</a>.<br><br>

				<b>How can I help?</b><br>
				One of the best ways to help is to email me suggestions - tell me what you've liked and hated about the dumbphones/featurephones you've owned, and what you'd
				like to see put into my phone. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:johnny@stene.xyz">johnny@stene.xyz</a><br><br>
				
				You can also help by donating - this goes towards building prototypes and buying the tools nessecary to build the phones. My PayPal is at <a href="https://paypal.me/jhonnystene">paypal.me/jhonnystene</a>
