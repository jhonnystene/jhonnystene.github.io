				<b>What is a Unikernel?</b><br>
				A Unikernel is a type of operating system kernel where the user can choose what portions of the kernel and its libraries they want to use, and then they can generate
				an image of their customized kernel. Think SUSE Studio (RIP) but for a kernel rather than a whole OS.<br><br>

				<b>Why make arcticOS a Unikernel?</b><br>
				Developing arcticOS and the hardware to run it has been far more expensive then I've thought, in both time and money. Making arcticOS a Unikernel will let me come up
				with some sort of development environment that I can license out (arcticOS itself will stay the same license) to allow developers to program arcticOS apps, as well as
				generate the specific Unikernel image for their needs. If it gains adoption, arcticOS itself could become the source of income I need to build the hardware it runs on.<br><br>

				<b>What additional functionality will be put into arcticOS? What will be removed?</b><br>
				arcticOS will at the very least need task switching and memory protection, but I'm also working on some built-in drivers for common hardware. This includes things like
				flash memory, wireless, audio, etc... but it also includes chips other than the RP2040 (although it will likely be ARM-only for now) so hardware designers can use whatever 
				suits their needs best. The distro of arcticOS that will ship on the phones will still look the same though - I've been working hard to make it so that any functionality that
				doesn't belong in the base kernel gets moved over to a standard library or applications rather than just removed.<br><br>

				<b>How can I help?</b><br>
				One of the best ways to help is to email me suggestions - tell me what you've liked and hated about the dumbphones/featurephones you've owned, and what you'd
				like to see put into my phone. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:johnny@stene.xyz">johnny@stene.xyz</a><br><br>
				
				You can also help by donating - this goes towards building prototypes and buying the tools nessecary to build the phones. My PayPal is at <a href="https://paypal.me/jhonnystene">paypal.me/jhonnystene</a>
