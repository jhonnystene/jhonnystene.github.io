			<p>
				<b>The Problem</b><br>
				The development of arcticOS has been a bit rocky, to say the least. Many of the problems I've had in development have been due to my own cockiness - I would
				think of an idea, and even if I have no idea what is involved in making it, I would always assume I can do it. This has caused me to make a number of mistakes
				and restart development a number of times - if I hadn't done that, I would be taking preorders right now for the first batch of phones.<br><br>

				<b>The Solution</b><br>
				I want to see this project finished and in the hands of people. I've done a lot of thinking recently about what the best course of action is to make that happen,
				and I've come to the conclusion that the original candybar design is the only way it will be ready in any sort of reasonable timeframe. I will be changing the
				design slightly, but I will not be doing anything if I don't know how. The biggest changes are switching to a Quectel modem and the RP2040 chip - which will
				bring better carrier compatibility and improved performance, respectively. I'll also be adding a few extra features here and there, like a flashlight and a
				directional pad for movement.<br><br>

				<b>What about the QWERTY E-ink?</b><br>
				If the candybar phone does well enough to fund development of the E-ink device, I'll work on that next. My original plan was to use a Raspberry Pi Compute
				Module to run the E-ink device - I played around with using Atmel chips but they're just too slow to work properly. The RP2040 chip should actually be able
				to run the screen (and the additional RAM required) without any problems - so ideally I'll use that and have the two phones use the same operating system.
				<br><br>

				<b>What about the current arcticOS codebase?</b><br> 
				I had planned to rewrite the current codebase anyways. In hindsight, Python was an awful choice - it's slow and drains the battery to quickly. The current
				codebase will likely be abandoned and the repo will be moved.<br><br>

				<b>Where are you at right now?</b><br>
				Luckily, I'm not starting completely from scratch. A lot of the old design is still usable on the new one - I can have a working (and much, much faster)
				EVT just by soldering a Raspberry Pi Pico on one of the old prototypes. I'm already working on the rewrite of arcticOS, and should have it booting on real
				hardware again in the coming days. I hope to share my progress with you all soon.<br><br>

				<b>How can I help?</b><br>
				One of the best ways to help is to email me suggestions - tell me what you've liked and hated about the dumbphones/featurephones you've owned, and what you'd
				like to see put into my phone. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:johnny@stene.xyz">johnny@stene.xyz</a><br><br>
				
				You can also help by donating - this goes towards building prototypes and buying the tools nessecary to build the phones. My PayPal is at <a href="https://paypal.me/jhonnystene">paypal.me/jhonnystene</a>
